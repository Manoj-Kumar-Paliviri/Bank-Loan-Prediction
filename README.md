# Bank-Loan-Prediction
The bank plays a vital role in the market economy. The success or failure of an organization
largely depends on the industryâ€™s ability to evaluate credit risk. Before giving the credit loan
to borrowers, the bank decides whether the borrower is bad (defaulter) or good (nondefaulter). The prediction of borrower status i.e. in the future borrower will be defaulter or
non-defaulter is a challenging task for any organization or bank. In our project, we used the
bank loan prediction dataset provided by kaggle.com. A bank's profit or a loss depends to a
large extent on loans i.e., whether the customers are paying back the loan or defaulting. By
predicting the loan defaulters, the bank can reduce its Non- Performing Assets. This makes
the study of this phenomenon very important.

This dataset consists of 981 samples which are further divided into two parts training set and
testing set. The training set has 614 samples and the test set has 367 samples. In the support
of this project, we have used libraries viz. scikit to import a machine learning algorithm
called Logistic Regression and pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, PIL (python imaging library),
joblib, streamlet libraries for the data analytics and data representation respectively. The
source code is written under a Python environment. After training the model, To prove realtime efficiency, we have evaluated our prediction model and it was measured with an
accuracy of 83%. In this process confusion matrix between tested and predicted values is also
analyzed. Further, the deployment was made using the Heroku cloud platform.

By using our Bank Loan Prediction, the right customers to be targeted for granting loans can
be easily detected by evaluating their likelihood of defaulting on loans. The model concludes
that a bank should not only target the rich customers for granting loans but it should assess
the other attributes of a customer as well which play a very important part in credit granting
decisions and predicting the loan defaulters.
